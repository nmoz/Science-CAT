        <h1>What is the Okapi?</h1>
        <p>
          The Okapi, also known as the ‘forest giraffe’, is a mammal that lives
          in the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It looks like
          a cross between a deer and a zebra. It is more closely related to the
          giraffe than the zebra, despite having striped markings similar to the
          zebra. Okapis are one of the oldest mammals on Earth but were unknown
          to scientists until 1901.

        <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
        <h4>Kingdom: Animalia</h4>
        <h4>Phylum: Chordata</h4>
        <h4>Class: Mammalia</h4>
        <h4>Order: Artiodactyla</h4>

      <div class="diet">
        <h1 style="margin-top: 70px">Diet</h1>
        <p>
          Okapis are herbivores meaning that it lives on a diet that is only
          comprised of plants. They eat tree leaves, grass, fruit, twigs and
          other vegetation they draw into their mouths with the help of their
          long prehensile tongues. They are known to consume over 100 different
          types of plants, many of which are harmful to other animals and
          humans. Similar to giraffes and cows, okapis have four stomachs that
          help it digest tough plants. An okapi can eat between 18 to 29
          kilograms of food every day, including minerals and salt from riverbed
          clay.

      </div>

      <div class="habitat">
        <h1 style="margin-top: 40px">Habitat</h1>
        <p>
          Okapis generally reside in tropical rainforests of Democratic Republic
          of the Congo's north-east region at altitudes of 500 to 1,000 metres.
          They live among dense rainforests along rivers & swamps. The brown and
          white stripes on its rump mimic the appearance of sunlight streaking
          through the leaves, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings.
          Okapis have several square kilometres of overlapping home ranges. They
          are very shy and elusive animals that are generally found wandering
          around the forest on their own. They are diurnal animals, which mean
          they are active during the day.
        </p>

      <div class="reproduction">
        <h1 style="margin-top: 40px">Reproduction</h1>
        <p>
          Okapis live alone but come together to mate. The Females have a
          reproduction period (gestation) of about 14-16 months and give birth
          to one young. During birth, mothers usually retreat into dense forests
          to give birth. Baby okapis are called calves. Similar to other hooved
          herbivores, okapi newborns are able to walk just 30 minutes after
          they’re born. Unlike other animals, the young do not seem to bond with
          their mothers and have been found nursing from two different females.
          A three-week-old okapi calf begins eating solid food and defecates
          (poops) for the first time between the ages of four and eight weeks.
          This helps predators from sniffing out the newborns until they have
          had time to develop and gain strength. Young Okapis don't hit full
          adult size until they're about three years old. Generally, female
          okapis breed every two to three years.

        <h4>
          - The ears of an okapi can rotate independently, so it can listen for
          sounds both in front and behind.
        </h4>
        <h4>
          - Okapi stripes are sometimes called "follow me" stripes, as the bold
          pattern makes it easy for a calf to follow its mother through the dark
          rainforest.
        </h4>
        <h4>
          - Like the giraffe, the okapi must splay its legs to reach the ground
          when drinking.

      <h1>Structural</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Long tongue:</b> this helps the okapi reach leaves from tall tree
        branches. It can be extended up to 25 cm long, assisting it in wiping
        the eyes, cleaning the ears and nostrils
      </p>
      <div class="side">
        <p>
          <b>Continuously growing teeth:</b> due to the excessive amount of
          grazing and chewing they do; their teeth naturally break down. This
          adaptations enables them to graze all day long because their teeth
          never stop growing!
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>Zebra stripes:</b> this zebra stripes helps the okapi blend itself
        more efficiently with its surroundings
      </p>
      <div class="side">
        <p>
          <b>Sharp sense of hearing:</b> Okapis have enhanced hearing ability
          that alerts them to run when they hear humans or predators in the
          distance.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
        <b>Scent glands:</b> they have scent glands on their feet that leave
        behind a tar-like substance to mark their territory.
      </p>

      <h1 style="margin-top: 50px">Physiological</h1>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
        <b>Newborns:</b> when okapi calves are born, they do not defecate (poop)
        until they are between four to eight weeks old. Although they are still
        tiny and frail, this adaptation allows them to remain shielded from
        their predator's powerful sense of smell.
      </p>
      <div class="side">
        <p>
          <b>Infrasonic sounds:</b> okapi mothers produce infrasonic calls that
          allow them to communicate with their calves without any predator
          hearing it. These noises are undetectable to the human ear
        </p>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
        <b>Unique digestive system:</b> this allows them to better digest and
        use energy from fibrous plants more efficiently.
      </p>

      <h1 style="margin-top: 50px">Behavioural</h1>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
        <b>Marking territory:</b> on their way home, the male okapis leave a
        trail of urine. They do this to let the other men know that their land
        is theirs alone. Often, two or more Okapi males will battle with their
        horns for the same territory.
      </p>
      <div class="side">
        <p>
          <b>New leaves:</b> to gain energy, the okapi consumes new leaves. If
          they consume the old leaves, then will eat the fungus and algae.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="evolution">
      <h1>Genetics & Evolution</h1>
      <p>
        The okapi and giraffe shared a common ancestor about 16 million years
        ago. According to a 2015 study published in the journal Royal Society
        Open Science, this ancestor, known as Canthumeryx, had an elongated
        neck. Following Canthumeryx, the family tree split into two branches,
        with giraffe ancestors on one side and okapi ancestors on the other. As
        time went on, the okapi’s ancestors developed shorter necks while the
        giraffe’s ancestors’ necks lengthened over time. Both, giraffes and
        okapis are in the same Giraffidae family, but diverge from each other in
        the Genus.
