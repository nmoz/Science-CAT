      <p>
        The Congo rainforest is situated in the central & western part of
        tropical Africa. It is the second largest rainforest and makes up
        approximately 18% of the world’s remaining tropical rainforest. The
        rainforest has a coastline to the Atlantic ocean and is bordered with
        six countries such as Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Cameroon,
        Central African Republic and Congo. The Congo River, the world's second
        largest river, passes through the rainforest.

      <h4>Seasons</h4>
      <p>
        The Congo Rainforest experiences a tropical climate all year, with
        abundant rainfall and high humidity and temperatures. In regions above
        the equator, the dry season lasts from November to March, and the rainy
        season lasts from April to October. In the south, it's the other way
        around.
      </p>
      <img src="seasons.jpg" />
      <h4 style="top: 500px">Temperatures</h4>
      <p style="top: 570px">
        The average temperature is quite consistent throughout the year, with
        just minor seasonal changes. Temperatures can range from the 15° to 27°
        C. The temperature difference between day and night can be as great as
        27 degrees Celsius.

      <img style="top: 520px" src="temperature.jpg" />
      <h4 style="top: 930px">Rainfall</h4>
      <p style="top: 990px">
        The rainforest receives a lot of rain each year, approximately 1220 to
        2032 mm on a yearly basis. According to a recent study, the dry season
        in the Congo rainforest has been growing longer for the past 25 years.
        If the dry season continues to lengthen, the forest's existing
        vegetation may transform into drought-tolerant species.

      <div class="special">
        <h5>
          The Congo rainforest occupies 1.5 million square miles in the African
          continent. It is known for its outstanding level of biodiversity,
          including over 600 tree species and 10,000 animal species. More than
          400 other mammal species, 1,000 bird species and 700 species of fish
          can be found here. About 11,000 plants have been identified in the
          Congo rainforest and 10% are unique to the region. It is found that
          the Congo rainforest’s soil and plants store incredible amounts of
          carbon – 8%, stopping it from being released into our atmosphere and
          fuelling climate change. The Democratic Republic of the Congo's
          forests are reported to be the world's fourth-largest terrestrial
          carbon reservoir. There are six national parks in the Congo Rainforest
          that are World Heritage Sites (meaning they have special significance
          to the world). It is one of the most significant wilderness areas left
          on Earth. It’s high level of biodiversity makes it a vibrant ecosystem
          that is always teeming with life.

        <h4>Biotic Factors</h4>
        <p>
          Biotic factors are living organisms that have an effect on other
          living things or the environment in an ecosystem. They are often
          categorised as the producers, consumers and decomposers. Some are:
        </p>
        <p style="top: 320px; right: 50%">
          - <b>Animals:</b> are consumers who potentially eat other consumers
          and depend on producers for some of their food. Their presence creates
          the biodiverse nature in the rainforest. Animals that live in the
          Congo rainforest are forest elephants, leopards, okapis, hippos, lions
          and gorillas.
        </p>

        <p style="top: 450px; right: 50%">
          - <b>Plants:</b> are the prime producers of the rainforest. They
          convert water, sunlight and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and
          provide astonishing support for a range of life. Some found in the
          Congo rainforest are. Trees such as the African oak, red cedar, walnut
          trees, mahogany tree and coconut palms.
        </p>

        <p style="top: 180px; right: 15%; left: 40%">
          - <b>Insects:</b> are involved in a broad spectrum of trophic
          interactions with other organisms. There are a numerous variety of
          insects found in the Congo rainforest such as bees, grasshoppers,
          caterpillars, praying mantises, beetles, dragonflies, scorpions,
          mosquitos, tsetse flies, ants, termites, spiders and many more.

        <h4>Abiotic Factors</h4>
        <p>
          Abiotic factors are non-living components of an ecosystem that
          influence its environment. The lithosphere, atmosphere, and
          hydrosphere are the most common sources of abiotic factors. Examples
          are:
        </p>
        <p style="top: 1080px; right: 50%">
          - <b>Water:</b> all living organisms depend on water and need it to
          survive and reproduce.
        </p>
        <p style="top: 1170px; right: 50%">
          - <b>Soil:</b> the Congo rainforest and every other rainforest depends
          on soil for its nutrients because majority of plants grow in soil. It
          is a major source of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.
        </p>
        <p style="top: 1080px; right: 8%; left: 42%">
          - <b>Sunlight:</b> like water, sunlight is a crucial element in the
          growth of plants. If there was no sunshine, plants wouldn’t be able to
          photosynthesis.
        </p>
        <p style="top: 1200px; right: 8%; left: 42%">
          - <b>Carbon dioxide:</b> this is an essential part of the cycle of
          life for plants. In the process of ‘photosynthesis’, plants use light
          energy – sunlight – to turn C02 and water into sugar and oxygen

      <h4>Mutualism...</h4>
      <p style="top: 180px">
        is the relationship between two different kinds of organisms where both
        of them benefit.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 60px; right: 32%">
        - A fascinating mutual relationship is between crocodiles and plovers.
        After a meal, the crocodile will position itself comfortably on the
        riverbank and sit with its mouth wide open. This action is a sign for
        the little bird to reach into the crocodile’s mouth and pick off any
        remaining food left in the reptile’s massive teeth. As a result, the
        tiny birds receive a free meal while the crocodile receives a free
        dental check up to prevent any infection from raw meat. If, during the
        process, the plover detects threat from another animal, it will fly away
        and alert the crocodile to dash into the water and hide from any
        possible danger.

      <h4 style="top: 570px">Commensalism...</h4>
      <p style="margin-top: 425px">
        is the interaction between species in which only one species benefits
        but the other is not harmed.
      </p>
      <p style="top: 705px; right: 35%">
        - One of the most common relationships in nature is between the birds
        and the trees. The birds presence generally does not bring harm to the
        tree, but it does provide shelter and protection for the bird.
      </p>

      <h4 style="top: 930px">Parasitism...</h4>
      <p style="top: 980px">

        - The strangler fig begins its life as a leaf on a tree branch. It winds
        around the tree and rises downwards towards the ground and upwards to
        the sky. After enveloping the tree, the strangler fig kills it by
        stealing sunlight and root space.
